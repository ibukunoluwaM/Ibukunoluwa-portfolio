            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>
              Hey there! I'm Ibukunoluwa Olateju, a front-end developer with a
              growing passion for building beautiful, functional and
              user-friendly web experiences. My journey into tech kicked off
              around 2022 fueled by nothing more than curiosity and the desire
              to create something meaningful on the web. What started as a
              simple interest quickly evolved into a full-blown commitment to
              learning, experimenting, and pushing myself beyond the basics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, I've dedicated countless hours to improving myself
              from writing clean and efficient code to understanding the finer
              details of responsive design and user interaction. I enjoy the
              challenge that comes with bringing ideas to life on a screen,
              ensuring that every website I build doesn't just look good, but
              works seamlessly across devices amd leaves user with a smooth,
              enjoyable experience. For me, it's not just about writing codes,
              it's about continuous learning, solving real problems, and
              creating digital experiences that people love using.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I'm not immersed in lines of code or figuring out how to fix
              a bug that just won't leave me alone, you will likely find me
              somewhere with my nose-deep in a book, surfing the internet,
              scribbling down thoughts, or stringing words together to create
              something worth reading. And if I'm not doing any of that ? Well,
              I might be enjoying a good game of football, because I'll never
              walk alone!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is just the beginning, and I'm excited about all the
              possibilities that lie ahead even as I continue to grow,
              collaborate, and contribute to the ever evolving world of tech.
